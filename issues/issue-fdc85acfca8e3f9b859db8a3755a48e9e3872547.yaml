title: Most of the code is uncommented
desc: |-
  As I've been writing the code mostly for myself, there's quite a lot of uncommented stuff around. This must change.
  
  Some things especially in need of commenting:
  - Operations on the account tree
  - Operations related to the [assets, liabilities, earnings] SNAFU
