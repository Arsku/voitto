title: "tlkmerge: actually combine accounts"
desc: |-
  tlkmerge now naively assumes all required accounts are present in the latest
  of the tlk files to be merged. this is not always the case. hairily the
  account structure is a somewhat complex tree where non-leaf nodes don't always
  have numbers, so hilarity ensues while trying to determine which account goes
  where.
