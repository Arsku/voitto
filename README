Voitto - a simple yet efficient double ledger bookkeeping system

My long term vision is to make a bookkeeping system that supports distributed
operation (in the DVCS sense). Some "web 2.0" features (e-invoices/social debt
tracking via a REST API) are also being planned.

At the moment Voitto only consists of a small collection of tools to work
with Tappio, a simple closed-source freeware bookkeeping application for
Windows. For more information about Tappio, see

	http://www.lahdenniemi.fi/jussi/tappio/

Current utilities:

extract.py - extract a period of time from a TLK file (with opening balances)
indent.py - a Tappio pretty-printer, useful for "git diff"
print_accounts.py - print the account tree
print_earnings.py - print incomes and expenses in CSV for nice pie graphs
renumber.py - sort and renumber events by date

Tests:

test_tappio.py - test the Tappio input/output features (test currently broken)
