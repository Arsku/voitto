Voitto - a simple yet efficient double ledger bookkeeping system

My long term vision is to make a bookkeeping system that supports distributed
operation (in the DVCS sense). Some "web 2.0" features (e-invoices/social debt
tracking via a REST API) are also being planned.

At the moment Voitto only consists of a small collection of tools to work
with Tappio, a simple closed-source freeware bookkeeping application for
Windows. For more information about Tappio, see

Current utilities:

extract.py - extract a period of time from a TLK file (with opening balances)
graph.py - print a totally useless GrahpViz graph of money flows
indent.py - a Tappio pretty-printer, useful for "git diff" (see below)
print_accounts.py - print the account tree
print_earnings.py - print incomes and expenses in CSV for nice pie graphs
renumber.py - sort and renumber events by date
tlkmerge.py - merge two or more TLK files
move_entries.py - all entries from one account number to another

Tests:

test_tappio.py - test the Tappio input/output features (test currently broken)



Using indent.py as a pretty-printer for "git diff":

In ~/.gitconfig, add this:

[diff "tappio"]
textconv = /path/to/voitto/indent.py

In the .gitattributes of your git repository, add this:

*.tlk diff=tappio

Now "git diff" should use indent.py for pretty printing.
